## «Überwacht 7 Mrd. Menschen im Visier» <br/> by Sylvain Louvet, France, 2020, 89 Minuten, DE

In France, intelligent police cameras analyze the behavior of pedestrians; in the U.S., police officers work with facial recognition; and in China, cameras can even recognize criminals by the way they walk. Thanks to artificial intelligence, state authorities have more power than ever before: they are able to see and hear everything, always and everywhere. What level of state surveillance can our individual freedoms withstand? Where will the security mania lead? And: Does the digital revolution turn seven billion inhabitants of the earth into suspects?

After the film we will have David and Fabio from «Digitale Gesellschaft» as well as members of «Digitale Selbstbestimmung Basel» as guests. They will introduce us to the «Digitale Gesellschaft», which works in Switzerland for citizen and consumer protection in the digital age. They will give us a short insight into their work around the discrimination issues of automated decision systems and facial recognition. This will be followed by an open discussion and the opportunity to ask questions to the speakers.
