# «RISK», by Laura Poitras, USA 2017, 90 Minutes, DCP, E/d/f

Filmed over six years, RISK is a compelling and complex character study that meets the cutting-edge politics of the media's more-or-less truthful reporting and the controversial consequences. Julian Assange, cornered for a decade, is undeterred, not even by the legal danger that could jeopardize his organization. As Poitras captures this story with unprecedented access, she finds herself caught between motives and contradictions of Assange and his inner circles. When she finally has to turn away from her protagonists, she is threatened by them. A film that is unusually consistent in its approach, even if it becomes very uncomfortable at the end.
