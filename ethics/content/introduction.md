This year [basel.codes](https://basel.codes) in collaboration with [Neues Kino](https://neueskinobasel.ch/) and [Critical Media Lab](https://criticalmedialab.ch) will organize a series of screenings that inquiry the collisions between ethics and technology.

In recent years we have seen the development and advancement of new and complex technologies that are coming under critical scrutiny because of their social implications.

Social media platforms are under fire after the Cambridge Analytica scandal; exposing how privacy can be weaponized to create political consent and dissent. AI-based systems have emphasized racial discrimination; while the gig economy has made precarious work even more precarious.

This and other topics will be adressed during the screenings. Each one of them will be opened by a short introduction and followed by a closing discussion.
