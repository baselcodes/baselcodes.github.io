This year [basel.codes](https://basel.codes) in collaboration with [Neues Kino](https://neueskinobasel.ch/) will organize 6 screenings that enquiry the collisions between ethics and technology.

Recent years have seen the development and advancement of new and complex technologies that are coming under critical scrutiny because of their social implications.

Social media platforms are under fire after the Cambridge Analytica scandal; exposing how privacy can be weaponized to create political consent and dissent. AI based system have shown to emphasize racial discrimination; while gig economy has made precarious work even more precarious.

This and other topics will be adressed during the screenings. Each one of them will be opened by a short introduction and followed by a closing discussion.
