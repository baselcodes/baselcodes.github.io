## "All Light, Everywhere" <br/> by Theo Anthony, US, 2021, 105 Minutes, E

All Light, Everywhere is an exploration of the shared histories of cameras, weapons, policing and justice. As surveillance technologies become a fixture in everyday life, the film interrogates the complexity of an objective point of view, probing the biases inherent in both human perception and the lens.

The documentary exists also in the form of an archive: All Light, Expanded is a website developed to show and narrate the 5 years of research that took Theo Anthony, director of the movie, to write the story.

After the screening we will have an open discussion with Seth Thompson and Bhavik Singh, the designers and technologists behind the archive. With them we will try to better understand the implications and biases of tools like a camera or an archive have on our everyday life.
