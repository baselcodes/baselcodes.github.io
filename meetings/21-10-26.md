# Meeting Max & Jean

**Deadline 18.11. for the decision about the format (month or Series)**


* Festival 1-2 Days
    * we do it zum Jubiläum ;)
* Cybermonth
    * Do & Fr Film, ev. Discussion
    * min 4 Movies
    * ev. there would be an addition from the neue kino cinema sonderbar
    * Saturday Workshop
    * Mai would be the first month that would be free, after that it's best to wait till fall (first possible september, after the silo kino)
    * Would put less pressure on the new kino people
* Series 6x a year
    * Samstag, Sonntag, Mo-Mi (not Do / Fr.)
    * Could be possible to start
    * First film in January
    * Beginning of December the first film and ev. workshop needs to be fixed:
    * Beginning of March would we need the next program point ready (the latest, nicer would be to announce it already at the january edition)
    * january, march, mai, (juli rather not), september, november, (january) (in fall can also be two movies in one month)

* Spielfilm für etwas leichte Kost dazwischen
* Silo Kino: 16mm Movies only (no scope!), no easy to find, Remus (the owner of the Silo) started to forbid all events because of security reasons, if possible yes, but let's see

## Finances & Rights
* usually events as ours are for free to get more people interested/educated
* kollekte usually pays off
* movie rights: file no problem, price ranges usually between 0 and 500.- per movie.
* the aim should be, that the kollekte or entry prices cover the costs of the movie rights
* as *coproduction* (they work for free and we too) there are no other costs
* costs from speakers and workshops would most likely to be covered from external ressources
* 5 to 10 bucks for workshops could finance those costs
* ask for money from potential foundations (the whole series)
