## MF: Draft Open Call

**Basel Codes Day 2023 – November XX 2023**

We cordially invite you to participate in this year's Basel Codes Day 2023! A free, one-day event to celebrate art, design, code, criticallity and diversity. We warmly welcome all people who are interested in code for creative and experimental projects. 

After organising three Processing Community Day's in 2019, 2020, and 2021 we are back under a new name. _Basel Codes Day (BCD)_ focuses on the local creative coding scene and opens the technological focus beyond Processing to include an even larger range of artistic uses of technology.

**Call For Participation**
As with the previous community days, the goal of BCD is to get together, share ideas and learn from each other. Do you engage with digital technology – old or new, low or high tech – in creative, fun, surprising or critical ways? We would love to have you! We have three possible formats to engage: Talks, Workshops and Performances. 

- Talks: Short lightning talks (10-15 min) to present a project, area of research, creative process or idea.
- Workshops: A workshop (1-2h) on a topic of creative technology. There can be different levels (beginner, intermediate, expert)
- Performance: An artistic live performance during our after party at XX.

Submit your idea with the following form till XX.XX.XXXX.
